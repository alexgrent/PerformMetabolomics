# PerformMetabolomics

Metabolomics allows to sturdy and identify small mocules within a biological system. It can reflect directly the underlying biochemical activity of samples and the molecural phenotype. This includes: sugars, lipids, amino acids, fatty acids, phenolic compounds, alkaloids. 

## Study approaches 

### Untargeted (global) approach:
This method measures as many metabolites as possible from a range of biological samples without any (intended) bias.

### Targeted approach:
This method is used when you want to measure sets of metabolites and have a specific biochemical question that you want to answer.

## Data sources
- Mass spectometry (majority of experiments)
- NMR

|                         | Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)             | Mass Spectrometry (MS)                            |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Sensitivity**          | Low                                          | High                                              |
| **Reproducibility**      | Very high                                    | Average                                           |
| **Number of detectable metabolites** | 30-100                                       | 300-1000+ (depending on whether GC-MS or LC-MS is used) |
| **Targeted analysis**    | Not optimal for targeted analysis            | Better for targeted analysis than NMR             |
| **Sample preparation**   | Minimal sample preparation required          | More complex sample preparation required          |
| **Tissue extraction**    | Not required – tissues can be analysed directly | Requires tissue extraction                        |
| **Sample analysis time** | Fast – the entire sample can be analysed in one measurement | Longer than NMR – requires different chromatography techniques depending on the metabolites analysed |
| **Instrument Cost**      | More expensive and occupies more space than MS | Cheaper and occupies less space than NMR          |
| **Sample Cost**          | Low cost per sample                          | High cost per sample                              |
